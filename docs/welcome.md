# The Garden of curiosity and daily observations

![Welcome to my Digital Garden](../static/img/welcome.png)

A digital garden is like an online journal or personal website, but with a twist. It's a virtual space where someone can cultivate and share their thoughts, ideas, and knowledge in a more dynamic and interconnected way.

Imagine a traditional blog as a series of chronological posts, like a diary. In contrast, a digital garden is more like tending to a garden. Instead of writing isolated articles or posts, content is organized as a network of interconnected notes, articles, and ideas. These "notes" can grow and evolve over time, linking to each other to form a web of knowledge.

It's called a "garden" because, like a real garden, it requires care and nurturing. Authors tend to their digital gardens by continuously adding, pruning, and connecting ideas. Readers can explore these gardens by following links and wandering through the interconnected paths of information.

In essence, a digital garden encourages a more organic and non-linear way of sharing and exploring knowledge, fostering a sense of curiosity and serendipity as you explore the interconnected ideas within it.
